## Code Overview

### HTML Structure

The HTML file (`index.html`) contains the basic structure of the web page with a `div` element representing the clock face. Inside this `div`, there are `p` elements for the clock indices and `div` elements for the hour, minute, and second hands.

### CSS Styling

The CSS file (`style.css`) provides the styles for the clock and its components. It sets the position, size, and appearance of the clock face and hands. Keyframe animations (`@keyframes`) are used to rotate the hands continuously, simulating the passage of time.
